description: Lecture presentation on proposed antineutrino detectors for probing the
  HPE in Earth's deep interior with directional sensitivity, tomography of the whole
  Earth for the localization of the HPE in the deep interior of the Earth, and the
  need for mobile antineutrino detectors for tomography.
